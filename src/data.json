Without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet. The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. About 1.3 million Earths would be needed to fill the Sun’s volume. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the largest planets to the smallest pieces of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures reach 15 million degrees Celsius. The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the constant flow of charged particles it sends, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.",
