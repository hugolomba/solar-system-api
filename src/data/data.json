Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the largest planets to the smallest pieces of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures reach 15 million degrees Celsius. The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the constant flow of charged particles it sends, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.",

      "resume": "In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Essentially, the main reason that led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to remove Pluto from the list of planets is the fact that it is not able to clear its own orbit, meaning it depends on other celestial bodies to influence its path – in this case, Neptune on one side, and various frozen objects from the Kuiper Belt on the other. Pluto – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier the size of Texas and Oklahoma. This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as tall as the Rockies, and it snows – but the snow is red.",
